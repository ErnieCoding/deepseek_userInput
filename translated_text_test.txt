## Sample description of therapy sessions
## CASE. Yulia
### Client's story: Yulia, 50 years old, married, has a 22-year-old daughter. Higher education (MIREA, faculty of mathematics). Yulia is the only child in the family, her mother died ten years ago (stroke), her father died four years ago (Covid). She lives alone with her husband. Daughter started living on her own a couple years ago. Owns a small restaurant (with two other partners). Together with two other restaurateurs, Julia owns a small restaurant.
Meetings are held online. A couple of times the meetings have been postponed at Julia's request (being busy at the restaurant and having to help her husband with his business, her husband has a fairly large logistics business).

#### Session 1.
A client comes in with the following request: "I am tired of living with my husband, but I can't leave because I don't have enough money to lead the lifestyle I used to without him.

Client: My request is quite trivial, I think many women face this problem. My husband is very annoying, we have been together for thirty years, I am with him only because of money. If I could earn as much as he does, I would not need any men. I don't care about him, he often comes home drunk (like with clients he has to meet in restaurants for work).

Therapist: You don't think that's true?

Client (angrily): How would I know? Maybe it is true, maybe it isn't. I suspect it's not true. And most importantly, it doesn't bother him at all that I may already be asleep and he's barging into the apartment like an elephant, in who knows what form, and I have to put up with it!!!!!

I notice that there is a look of squeamishness on his face, a strong displeasure.

Therapist: What would you like from our work?

Client: Probably help me to make a choice at last - to leave him or to tolerate him further. Or rather, this way - if to stay, then to react more calmly.

I realize that there is not enough information about the Client's life. At the same time I feel some incomprehensible desire to defend her husband (apparently, because the Client regards her husband's words as a lie, without knowing whether he is lying or not). I refrain from making any assessments.

Therapist: Tell us more about why, as you just said, you can't leave your husband. You have your own resources, don't you?

Client: I do, but it's very small. I have a small restaurant, we are three partners. My maximum income is 250 -300 thousand a month, this is in good months, but it can be much less. And the expenses ........The client talks about them for a long time, from which it becomes clear that her income is clearly not enough for such a lifestyle.

I understand that the Client's process is the difficulty of making a choice.
From the interruptions I see deflexion - tells a lot, quickly and emotionally details of family life, at my attempt to slow down - at first slows down, but then quickly goes back to the previous pace; projection - prefers to see known untruths in the words of her husband, gets irritated when I highlight it to her. I assume that behind this acute irritation is dissatisfaction with herself because of the inability to make a choice (or inability to earn?), which is retroflexed.

Noticed an interesting point that as a therapist I wanted to defend my husband. I have a hard time dealing with unfair accusations and want to start arguing right away. This is apparently my process.

 #### Session 2.
Client arrives late (generally uncharacteristically late). She looks depressed and sad.
Right back to the topic of divorce.

Client: I have decided to get a divorce. I can't live like this anymore...

Therapist: In our last meeting, we worked more with asking how you can make a choice. Did something happen?

Client: Nothing new, except that he came home yesterday irritated, even angry, didn't ask me a word about how I was feeling, and immediately stated that I was spending a lot of money. Tired of it already ...
Long and vividly tells me that in fact she does not really spend so much and in general only on necessary things, and her husband just nags her, and she can not stand these nags.

Therapist: Have you made a decision, or are these just words?

Client: I don't know, I think I have, but you asked, and I'm not sure

Therapist: It depends on what kind of request we will work with today.

Client: Don't rush me, I don't know myself, this is the request.

Client is angry. Perhaps it can be seen as a parallel process between us, she can't make up her mind about the request, just as she can't make up her mind about a serious decision in her life. Nervous, angry with me. I'm waiting for her to calm down a bit.

Therapist: Let's go back to your choice. Ð’
you would like to leave your husband, who annoys you, it seems, quite often, on the one hand, and on the other hand, you don't really understand how you will live without him, namely without his financial support. Right?

Client: Right, yeah. I'm so tired of pretending that everything is fine. And on the other hand, I'm afraid of being alone. I'm 50 years old, who's going to need me? (pause).

Therapist: Let's talk about this fear

Client: Although, I recently had a friend divorced..... goes into a long story about her friend, speaks emotionally and very quickly. Jumping from the topic of her friend to her husband who is always doing something wrong.
I notice her deflexia. Since I myself am deflexic, I try not to follow the client into lengthy discussions and thus not to get into a parallel process. I return to my question about fear. I am trying to clarify what the client is afraid of - loneliness or limited finances. It seems that she does not really understand what exactly her fear is, what prevents her from making this or that choice. For the most part, my client is in her head (self), at the first question about feelings she goes into her head, discussing facts, actions and consequences of them.
As a therapist I saw her deflexion and how difficult it was for me not to go into reflexion and start "saving" the client based on analyzing the facts.


#### Session 3.

Arrives on time, calmer than last time, collected

I start the session by recalling what we talked about in the last session, and I would like to go back to the fear of divorce, and try to determine what it is, what the client is more afraid of.

Therapist: Imagine - you decide to get a divorce, what is the worst thing about it?

Client: I'm afraid of being alone. What if I never meet anyone else, I'm old, who would be interested in me?

Therapist: We started with the fact that you are afraid of being left without financial support from your husband and that you will not be able to lead the life you are used to, which I think is a well-founded fear, or are we putting that out of the question?

Client: That too, of course, but I'm even more afraid of living like this for the rest of my life.....

Therapist: How exactly?

Client (irritated): Well - alone and without money

Therapist: Let's try to imagine, you are divorced, living alone, on your own money from the restaurant, how do you feel?

The client has to be slowed down, immersed in her feelings, because she, visibly irritated, immediately begins to explain to me that it is clear what she feels, namely - nothing good, as she does not have enough money for travel, to pay for her daughter's apartment (they rent an apartment for her), immediately jumps to the story of past joint trips with her husband and the cost of these trips. Tells emotionally, interestingly. I catch myself thinking that I am ready to discuss travel experiences with her.
When I do manage to slow her down and make her notice her feelings a little, she almost cries.

Therapist: I can see you have tears in your eyes

Client: Yes, and I don't think it's constructive at all - what you're doing right now, I need to put things in perspective and just make a good and thoughtful decision - divorce him or stay with him. Instead, I'm just blurring around like an idiot.

Then it turns out that the tears are associated with the picture that the client drew - she is alone, and so will always be, because she is already "old", looks bad, does not always feel well, and it is unlikely that anyone will be interested in her "such a junk". And, therefore, there is practically no choice.

The client still deflexes a lot, avoiding any minimal immersion in feelings. In addition, the introject is revealed - "if I am so old, I am already on the dustbin of history, and no one needs me".
Deflexion and retroflexion of feelings are found from session to session. It is good that you managed to immerse yourself in feelings at least a little bit.

#### Session 4:

Comes in a little late, apologizes in a quiet voice, shoulders slumped, gaze downward, sits as if all squeezed together

Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Julia?
Client: (rubs her hair) I don't know... It's hard. I've been thinking about our last conversation all week
The client doesn't seem like herself, usually she is more collected, loud, sometimes even aggressive.

Therapist: What exactly have you been thinking about?

Client: I was thinking about my parents ..... They were always on the side of Sergei (that's her husband's name), both my mother and father, they never supported me in any of our conflicts, even when we were very young, when we were still studying at the institute (the client and her husband studied together at the institute, where they met).
)... and even when I was right .....

Further recalls an episode from her life, when she, having quarreled with her husband, came to her parents, and they "kicked her out", saying that "you have a great husband, everyone should have such a husband, without him you will be lost" (to summarize).

Therapist: How do you feel when you remember these words?

Client: (after a long pause) Fear, no - horror that they were probably right, and I'm not good for anything....

Therapist: Even from the information I have, I think it's possible to conclude that that's not true, not at all.... You do run your own business, however small, don't you?

The client "popped" out of her feelings, obviously with my help, as I went off in my head. Although I thought it was important at this point to highlight to her that she too has her accomplishments.
After going into deflexion, the client began to talk a lot about her business and her partners, who have much more experience in the restaurant business, and all decisions are essentially always made by them, even when she disagrees with them and has her own working ideas.

I try to bring the client back to the experience of fear of being "good for nothing" according to her parents

Client: Yes, I am afraid that I can't do anything on my own, my parents were right, others always help me in everything, especially my husband, others make decisions for me. How can I get a divorce and stay alone?

I try to support the client and tell her my story about how difficult it was for me after my divorce from my first husband, who solved the main financial and domestic issues of our family.

Client (irritated): You're not helping me make a choice! According to you, it turns out that I have something to be afraid of, but this fear should be ignored and I should go straight ahead.

I notice that, in her hesitation, the client interprets my words in a way that would help her make a decision.

The session is again framed around the client's process with the difficulty of making a decision.
I see deflexion again (the restaurant story "ate up" a good half of the session. The complexity of the decision to leave her husband - the parental introjection of "you can't do anything without your husband" - becomes clearer. My own habit of going into my head and "fixing" the client allowed the client to begin to reflex and withdraw from her feelings, although I consciously wanted to support the client.


#### Session 5.

This time the client arrived exactly on time, seemed calmer than usual.
I think she made eye contact more often, perhaps this indicates more trust.

Therapist: How are you today?

Client: (thoughtfully) You know, after our last appointment, I've been thinking a lot.... And I caught myself on a strange thought... I was thinking about all my worries - divorce, not divorce, whether I will meet someone, whether I will not meet someone, whether my parents were right that I am not capable of anything alone....

Therapist: What kind of thoughts?

Client: I don't really understand what I want... I guess that's why I can't make any decision.
Silence. Pausing

Therapist: What did you feel at that moment? When that thought came into your head

Client (as if surprised): Confusion... Why it never occurred to me before. I used to always think - what would be the right thing to do, who to consult, so that it would be right and good for sure

Therapist: What is right and good?

Client: Well, so that you don't regret what you did, what decision you made...
Therapist: It seems to me that in order not to regret the decision made, you need to first think about what do you want?

Client: Yes, but it's like opening a new door. Anxious

Therapist: What is scary behind this new door?

Client (quietly): Like I have to go in there alone, and there's no one to consult with, and there's the unknown ...

This is the first time the client uses a metaphor, quite vividly. I think this indicates that she has become a little more aware of her ID.

I ask the client to mentally go behind this door and try to "feel her desires". First of all, those that relate to her husband and her life together with him. After a couple of minutes, the client says that it seems to her that her desire is not to be alone in her old age.

Therapist: How do you feel when you think about the prospect of being alone?

Client: Terribly sad..... It's probably not even about finances.... I mean, we've been together for so many years, I've never been alone. It's like I've been put in an orphanage....

Suddenly she starts to remember good moments from her and her husband's life together. On the one hand, deflexing, but on the other hand, I think some very strong
 tension, and she stopped seeing everything in black. Apparently, it was possible to get through a little bit of merging with both myself (when I don't know what I want at all) and parental figures. It's good that she's started to think about her own wants and needs, not tied to authority figures.
As a therapist, I was able to establish good trusting contact with the client, not to rush the process, to help the client realize her feelings.


#### Session 6.

Client arrived a little late, didn't apologize, which is not like her. Looked more animated than usual, speech seemed more enthusiastic than usual. Gestures actively, maintains eye contact.

Therapist: How are you since our last meeting?

Client: Pretty good. Today I would like to talk about problems with my daughter.
I'm surprised that the request is changing. I thought we would still be talking about the prospect of divorce or saving the marriage. Perhaps the client has a more pressing problem today.

When asked what happened, the client says that her daughter, who had recently become separated, in a phone conversation abruptly asked the client to get off her back and "keep your long nose out of her life." According to the client, all she wanted to know was whether her daughter had cleaned the apartment (because on her last visit she had found it "a mess"). The client was "mad, especially considering the fact that she was paying her daughter for the apartment". However, my client could not tell her daughter that she was uncomfortable and hurt to hear this. She was afraid of "conflict and damaged relationships".
I supported my client that rudeness from children is always very hurtful (my son is 22, and he sometimes offends me with his harsh statements).

Therapist: What are we going to work with today?
Client: I want to figure out what is the best thing for me to do - should I stop paying her rent or should I express my resentment or both? And, by the way, when my parents gave my husband and I our old apartment, we were grateful!!!! And I have never been rude to my parents, not even a thought!!!!

Again I see controlling parental figures that were impossible to argue with. I see the introject - "whoever is financially dependent has the right to control what happens". By the way, this same introject actually appeared in the work with the request for divorce ("I can't get a divorce, because my husband provides financially).

I think here we need to work with the client's desire to strictly control everything (for example, she tries to control what her daughter eats, living separately, to bring her home-cooked food, not always warning her in advance that she is coming over, but simply opening the door with her key. The control is clearly similar to parental control, which also applied to all areas of my client's life. I am also surprised that the client does not express disappointment to her daughter because she is afraid of ruining the relationship, but she is not afraid to open the door with her key. I don't know how to interpret this (since she pays for the apartment, she has the right?).

#### Session 7.

The client arrived on time, clearly upset. Barely says hello and starts a dialog. She gesticulates very vigorously, which is called "on edge".

Client: I will complain to you about my daughter again. I can't get her out. She is not a stupid girl, she has such a great education, but in her head......
Therapist: Tell me what happened, please.
Client: We agreed to meet yesterday at a restaurant (by the way, it was my daughter's birthday). You should have seen in what form she came!!! In a tracksuit!!!
Therapist: In a nice tracksuit, I guess?
I try to defuse the situation, speaking half-jokingly/half-seriously, smiling. However, the client does not smile back, my half-joke fails.
Therapist: It seems to me that young people nowadays do not pay too much attention to their appearance. They don't care, as they call it.
Client, after a short pause, thoughtfully: Perhaps, but it has never done anyone any good. And you should have seen her - no makeup, in stupid sneakers, and on the sleeve - a stain!!!! It's not just a tracksuit, it's also a dirty tracksuit.....

Therapist: Why is your daughter's appearance so important to you?

Client: Don't you understand?
She speaks with aggression, apparently angry that I am stupid and don't understand obvious things.

Therapist: I would still like to hear it from you.
Client: My husband and I found time to go home after work to change clothes, after all - a birthday party, a restaurant, and she .....
She's quiet for a long time.
Therapist: Do you think she's talking about
disrespected you by the way she looked.
Client: Actually, that's not even the point.... She's always wearing who knows what, she doesn't wear makeup at all, she doesn't even have makeup at home! Here I am at her age!!!!

The client talks at length and in detail about what a young girl should look like, in her opinion. When I ask her why it is so important, she suddenly declares that if she looks the way she does now, she will never be able to marry, much less marry successfully.

Client: She's 22 years old and she's not seriously dating anyone!!!! Of course, who needs her looking like this????

Repetitive process: the desire to control everything, especially if it concerns loved ones, in particular a daughter.
Introject - the girl must "get married on time and start a family. Who is she without a family?"
For my part, I feel the desire to protect my daughter and her right to choose. At the same time I feel the desire to share myself (I have several marriages under my belt), but something clearly prevents me from doing so (perhaps fear that I will cease to be an authority for the client), instead I tell her about my feelings about my son and his personal life.
I see that this is exactly the same introject that prevents her from actually making the decision to divorce her husband.
I see the client's strong anxiety for her daughter's fate, which is a completely understandable feeling. I think it is worth working on reducing this anxiety.

##### Session 8.
Client arrives on time, looks tired, even a little apathetic. She is in no hurry to start a dialog.
When I ask her how her week has been, she says she has been thinking a lot about what we talked about in the previous session.

Therapist: What were you thinking about? Did you think of anything new for yourself?
Client: Not really new, but I think my fear for my daughter, for her future is slowly eating me up....

I notice that for the second week we haven't talked about problems with my husband, about possible divorce and making such a decision. I think that to some extent it is easier for her to talk about her daughter than to go back to the fateful decision about herself. I decide that today I will not ask about her husband and thus bring her back to the previous topic.

Therapist: Tell me more about this fear.
The client does not answer, I myself have to break the pause, which, as it seems to me, lasted for several minutes (I myself have a very difficult time with pauses, I should learn from this).
Therapist: Did something else happen? Or were you just thinking about the issues we raised last time?
Client: Nothing much happened...., but my daughter promised to come to our dacha for the weekend, for three days, but she came only for half a day and left. She said she had a lot to do at work.....

The daughter has her own small business producing goods for the movie industry (which in my personal opinion for her age is an indicator of successful success)
Therapist: You know, it seems to me that your daughter is so good, at such an age she was able to organize a business that brings her, even if it is not huge, but income. That's so great
Client, with aggression: What's the use of this income? It's not great money, you can't live on it!

I notice, and not for the first time, that as soon as the client feels that I am taking my daughter's side and thus not supporting her point of view, she becomes obviously angry. I am probably also, in her opinion, not allowing myself to be controlled at that point either. Perhaps the same introjection is at play - "he who pays, orders the music" and, accordingly, I have to exclusively agree with her point of view.

Next, the client talks at length and in detail about the "fleeting" romances her daughter is having. Nothing "serious" and no "promising relationship" turns out. And the reason for this is the girl's appearance (the previous session was devoted to her daughter's "inappropriate" appearance and business, which takes up too much time.

In the course of the session I have an idea that the daughter may have simply gotten tired of my client's constant nagging and lecturing, so she "ran away" from the dacha, citing urgent matters.

I ask the client to tell me more about her conversations with her daughter.
Therapist: Try to go back to last Friday morning, when Anya came to your dacha. Describe in detail, if you can, how your meeting took place, what was talked about.....
Client: How was the meeting ..... She arrived as usual, with this stupid ponytail on her head, without makeup, in the hell in what.... I told her about it at once..... Then at the table I tried to find out who she was dating, if she had a boyfriend .....

Among other details.
It turns out that my Client believes that her daughter is overweight, and the Client has started restricting her from certain foods....
I try to highlight to the Client the fact that her tightly controlling behavior may not be very pleasant for her adult daughter. Time running out, I tell her we can continue this next time. I think I let time control slip a bit by allowing the client to go into detail.

The client's figure remains a huge desire to control her daughter, including her personal life. There is a projection of parental behavior (parents constantly explained to the client the importance of family and marriage in a woman's life) and her own introjection - a woman should be married, preferably to a financially secure man. I see how in our relationship the client also tries to control me, and reacts quite aggressively to my "disagreement" with her opinion.

#### Session 9.

Client is late, apologizes, says she doesn't feel well. To my intervention that we could have rescheduled the session if she had warned me in advance, she replies that she would not want to reschedule because she is very worried and "the problem is only getting worse". She looks tired, constantly changes her posture, and doesn't seem to be feeling well.

Therapist: Let's discuss the worsening problem. What is it?
Client: What is it? My daughter is a disappointment.
She stops talking for quite a long time, sobs, I see "wet" eyes.
Therapist: What are you disappointed about, Julia?

Client (very aggressively): Everything! Absolutely everything!!! What she eats, how much she sleeps, she can hang around all night, how she looks, what she is wearing, what kind of apartment she has!!!! I've told you all this....
Therapist: What does that mean to you? Untidy apartment, improper diet?
Client (after a long pause, she finds such questions difficult): Well, like what?  I put my whole life on it .... I was even told by a friend that I made a project out of my daughter...So much money invested in her ....

Therapist (impressed by the word "project"): You don't think you have a very "successful project"?
Client, choosing words with difficulty: Not that my project is unsuccessful, but as if it was successful and then something went wrong and it stopped being successful....
Therapist: What do you think this project should be like if it is successful?
Client (clearly with aggression, she apparently feels disapproval at my question, and I concede that she feels right): Don't you understand? My daughter should look decent, or better attractive, have a normal personal life, better family.... To be happy at the end of the day.....
Therapist: Does she seem unhappy to you?
Client: I don't know.... but years go by, and if she doesn't get married in time, doesn't give birth to a child, she will stay alone.... I'm not eternal
Therapist: Maybe for your daughter happiness is not in marriage? Or not just in marriage? Or not in marriage right now?
Client: She doesn't realize much! Here's the thing...

Taking her back to parental figures and her feelings when her parents controlled her. The client struggles to go into these feelings. Eventually admits that she "doesn't want to remember it, it was so hard for her."

In response to my intervention that maybe in some issues it is worth loosening such tight control and talking to her daughter about something really important, she gets angry at first, but then promises to think about it.

My difficulty is that, to me, the issue seems simple and does not require much effort to solve. I want to immediately "lay it all out". I can hardly keep myself from "behavioral instructions", and from getting annoyed, as I vividly imagine her "riding her daughter's brain".
Same figure - hypercontrol and anxiety about her daughter's future. Introject - "a woman's happiness is family", and to get married you need to "look".


#### Session 10.
The client arrives on time, looks more cheerful than in our last session, but I notice carelessness in her clothes (she has never been dressed like this before, she is usually dressed stylishly and tastefully). It used to happen that she immediately entered into a dialog without wasting a minute, or almost immediately, answering my question with a description of the problem (as they say, without going around and around), but today, when I asked her how she was doing and what she wanted to discuss, she asked me to give her a couple of minutes "to gather her thoughts".

Client: I was choosing between two questions.... You and I still haven't finalized my decision not to get divorced.....

Therapist: What do you mean, the final point?
Client: Well, you kind of supported me in my decision not to get divorced, or not to get divorced yet.
Ter
Therapist: Julia, I think I just helped you to see the good things in your marriage, and I'm giving you support as a client and in that sense I will support any decision you make.
Client (again as if withdrawing into herself): You're not making it easy for me... well ok, so be it... Here I am thinking, or rather, I wanted to talk about whether this is the right decision after all.... But then it happened again with my daughter.....

I notice that all decisions (even about what to discuss with the therapist) are not always easy for the client. It seems that in her head there is an illusion that there is only one right solution to any problem, and it is necessary to figure out what the only right solution is.

The client goes on to tell me that her daughter was supposed to call and come, but did not call, did not come, and did not answer the phone for twenty-four hours. This episode threw my client into fear, and further, when it turned out that the daughter had simply fallen asleep, her phone was dead and she only dialed her the next morning when my client was already on her way to her daughter's house to find out what was going on. The "cherry on the cake" was that the daughter "never thought to apologize" for the trouble she had caused the parents.

Therapist: We still haven't settled on a request. Hearing a lot of anxiety about the daughter. Dissatisfaction with her behavior. I understand you very much in this place, I was always very worried about my son when we lived together.

Client: You know what else made me very angry? When her husband answered the phone, he talked to her almost as if nothing had happened. Just a little scolding. He said Mom had "gone into orbit." Can you believe that?
Therapist: What was so upsetting about that?
Client: What about it? I expected him to scold her properly, to tell her that she should not be treated like that. But instead he talked to her very well and, so that you could understand my situation ..... they were going to go to Kamchatka together.

When I asked why the two of them, without her, it turned out that the client was simply not ready for such a flight, for the conditions of the trip and so on.

Therapist: I hear that you are simply not ready for such a trip, otherwise you would go with three people. Is that right?
Client: Well, yes (as if confused).
Therapist: I think it's really great that your husband and daughter have such a good relationship, I can only envy you.
Client: On the one hand, it's like that..... On the other hand, it's as if they know something that I don't know, as if they're joking with me, as if they're shutting me out in some way.
Therapist: And what does it mean for you that they seem to be shutting you out?
Client: For me? Unknown in some way.... Like they're going to make a mess .....

Trying to bring back to the client the fact that up to this point in general they haven't "done anything wrong". Again highlighting to her her hyper-controlling behavior, both in regards to her daughter and husband. Trying to lower the degree of anxiety. I find myself at a point where on the one hand I understand her worries, and on the other hand I feel very sorry for my daughter and angry at the client that she seems to "suffocate" the girl with her guardianship.
