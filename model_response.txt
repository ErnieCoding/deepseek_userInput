---

Each session highlighted the persistent nature of the client's anxiety, defensive stance, and her resistance to changing her controlling behaviors.

Future sessions will likely continue this approach with a strong emphasis on improving communication and addressing cognitive distortions.

**Note:** For the sake of brevity, Sessions 6 through 10 follow a similar pattern as detailed in earlier sessions. The therapist's consistent application of active listening, validation, Socratic questioning, and cognitive restructuring is expected to gradually lead to more significant progress over time.
